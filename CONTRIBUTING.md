# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in this project!

## Important Notice

This is a **personal project** that I built to solve my own needs. I'm sharing it publicly in case others find it useful, but please understand:

- **No guarantees** about functionality, reliability, or fitness for any particular purpose
- **No commitment** to maintenance, bug fixes, or feature development
- **No timeline** for reviewing or merging contributions

## Feedback Welcome

I genuinely appreciate feedback, bug reports, and suggestions. Feel free to open an issue to:

- Report bugs you encounter
- Suggest improvements or new features
- Ask questions about how something works

However, I can't promise when (or if) I'll be able to address them. This is a side project and my availability varies.

## Pull Requests

You're welcome to submit pull requests, but please keep expectations realistic:

- I may take a long time to review them
- I may not merge them if they don't fit my use case
- I may ask for significant changes

If you need changes urgently, forking is probably your best option.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind and respectful. That's it.
